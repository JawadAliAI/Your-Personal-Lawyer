# üì∏ Adding Screenshots to README

To add a screenshot of your LawGPT interface:

## Method 1: Manual Screenshot
1. Start your Flask application: `python flask_app.py`
2. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
3. Take a screenshot of the interface
4. Save it as `lawgpt_screenshot.png` in the project root
5. The README will automatically display it

## Method 2: Using Screenshot Script (Optional)
1. Install Selenium: `pip install selenium`
2. Install ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
3. Run: `python screenshot_capture.py`

## Method 3: Use Online Services
1. Visit https://via.placeholder.com/
2. Create a custom placeholder image
3. Replace the placeholder URL in README.md

## Current Placeholder
The README currently uses a placeholder image from:
https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/1a365d/ffffff?text=LawGPT+Interface+Screenshot

Replace this URL with your actual screenshot path once you have one.
